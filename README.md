# GRID vs. Gaia Rulebook

A 2 player spell casting game made during Ludum Dare 47

Theme: Stuck in a loop

Stuck in a ... time loop?


## Lore

A great war between Magic and Science has broken out. Many low-level ESPers and mages are suddenly thrown into combat, but there's a problem. Nobody knows any spells with which to attack or defend! It is your job as either a soldier of science, or a mongering mage to destroy the enemy and preserve your faction's dogmatic way of life.


## Factions

### The Order of the GRID

  * Made up of ESPers who use advanced sciences to modify the world around them
  * Receives extra points for Metaphysics Blueprints incantations
  * Have an emphasis on electricity, light, and gravity

### Gaia Timeworn

  * Made up of Mages who use earthly magic to manipulate time and space
  * Receives extra points for Primordial Scrolls incantations
  * Have an emphasis on earth, wind, fire, air (etc)


## Spells

Spells are uttered aloud over a series of turns as players cast them using word cards from their hand.

### Spell Classes

  * Damage
  * Mend
  * Utility
  * Wild
  * Eraser

Damage spells inflict damage upon the opponent. Mend spells repair damage to the character. Utility spells grant players extra cards. Wild spells have unknown effects until after they are casted. Eraser spells interfere with the opponent's spell casting.

A spell can belong to more than one class.

### Spell Cards

#### Science Metaphysics Blueprint

A metaphysics blueprint is one of the spell types that characters can find. It would have a blue color and contain the ordered words which make up a spell incantation.

Science Metaphysics Blueprints are most effective when used by ESPers.

#### Magic Primordial Scroll

These are aged paper scrolls which roll up and are kept together with string.

Magic Primordial Scrolls are the other type of spell that characters can find. It contains the ordered words which make up a spell incantation.

Most effective when used by mages.



## Game Contents

The game consists of

  * n Spell cards
  * n Word cards
  * n Chance cards
  * 2 Faction cards
  * 2 D20 dice
  * 1 D6 die

## Setup

  1. Create three stacks of shuffled cards. One each for **Spells**, **Words**, and **Chances**. (GAIA and GRID cards are shuffled together)
  2. Each player places a D20 near them which signifies the character's health. At the start of the game, each player has 16 health.
  3. Players randomly choose a faction by placing the two faction cards face down and each pointing to the card they want. Rock paper scissors settles any conflicts.
  4. Flip a coin to determine the player who goes first. The winner of the coin toss decides if they want to go first or second.
  5. Each player draws 5 cards from the **Words** stack, starting with the player who is going first.

## Game Board Layout

### Grimoire

The area which holds the three stacks of cards. **Spells**, **Words**, and **Chances**

### Hand

The cards that a player has in their possession

### Incantation Zone

The area in front of each player which holds the sequence of **Words** which have been uttered. Contains 8 numbered slots.

## Win Condition

The player with the last standing character wins the game.

## Player Turn Flow

### 1. Discover

Your character's vocabulary expands as they explore the arena. The player draws one **Word** card.

### 2. Descry

Roll a 6 sided die to see if your character finds a **Science Metaphysics Blueprint** or **Magic Primordial Scroll** in the arena. If you roll a 4 or greater, draw a **Spell Card**.

### 3. Deliver

Spells can take many turns to cast. The player *may* place down one **Word Card** into their incantation zone to work towards a spell cast. **Word Cards** must be placed in the lowest numbered available **Incantation Zone** slot.

If a **Word Card** is placed which completes a spell in the player's hand, the spell is immediately cast. The effect listed on the **Spell Card** is carried out. See [Casting Spells](#casting-spells) for complete information.

Your character is only capable of casting spells listed in **Spell Cards** that you have in your **Hand**. Memorizing spells doesn't count!

You can place **Word Cards** into your **Incantation Zone** before you know what spell you are going to cast. You don't even need a **Spell Card** in your hand to place down a **Word Card**. This can be used for many purposes such as minimizing the amount of turns required to cast a spell when you eventually get a hold of a spell card. Delivering words can also be an opportunity for bluffing, by leading an opponent to believe that you are casting a spell which you have no intention of completing.

### 4. Desist

The end of your turn is declared, at which point it becomes the other player's turn.
