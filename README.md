A 2 player combatative spell casting board game made during [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 47

![A view of the prototype game board](https://github.com/insanity54/ld47/blob/master/art/spells.jpg?raw=true)

## Lore

> A great war between Magic and Science has broken out. Many low-level ESPers and mages are suddenly thrown into combat, but there's a problem. Nobody knows any spells with which to attack or defend! It is your job as either a soldier of science, or a mongering mage to destroy the enemy and preserve your faction's dogmatic way of life.


## Factions

### The Order of the GRID

  * Made up of ESPers who use advanced sciences to modify the world around them
  * Receives extra points for Metaphysics Blueprints incantations
  * Have an emphasis on electricity, light, and gravity

### Gaia Timeworn

  * Made up of Mages who use earthly magic to manipulate time and space
  * Receives extra points for Primordial Scrolls incantations
  * Have an emphasis on earth, wind, fire, air (etc)


## Game Contents

The game consists of

  * 64 Word cards
  * 24 Spell cards
  * 14 Chance cards
  * 2 Faction cards
  * 2 Spell lists
  * 2 Chance lists
  * 2 Word lists
  * 2 D20 dice
  * 1 D6 die

## Setup

  1. Create three stacks of shuffled cards. One each for **Spells**, **Words**, and **Chances**. (GAIA and GRID cards are shuffled together)
  2. Each player places a D20 near them which signifies the character's health. At the start of the game, each player has 16 health.
  3. Players randomly choose a faction by placing the two faction cards face down and each pointing to the card they want. Rock paper scissors settles any conflicts.
  4. Flip a coin to determine the player who goes first. The winner of the coin toss decides if they want to go first or second.
  5. Each player draws 5 cards from the **Words** stack, starting with the player who is going first.

## Game Board Layout

### Grimoire

The area which holds the three stacks of cards. **Spells**, **Words**, and **Chances**

### Hand

The cards that a player has in their possession

### Incantation Zone

The area in front of each player which holds the sequence of **Words** which have been uttered. Contains 8 numbered slots.

### Character Level Zone

The area to the right of each player which has 5 numbered card slots. The number of **Spell Cards** placed in these slots indicate player's power level.

## Win Condition

The player with the last standing character wins the game.

## Player Turn Flow

### 1. Discover

Your character's vocabulary expands as they explore the arena. The player draws one **Word** card.

### 2. Descry

Roll a 6 sided die to see if your character finds a **Science Metaphysics Blueprint** or **Magic Primordial Scroll** in the arena. If you roll a 4 or greater, draw a **Spell Card**.

### 3. Deliver

Spells usually take many turns to cast. The player *must* place down exactly one **Word Card** into their **Incantation Zone** to work towards a spell cast. **Word Cards** must be placed in the lowest numbered available **Incantation Zone** slot.

If a **Word Card** is placed which completes a spell in the player's hand, the spell is immediately cast. The effect listed on the **Spell Card** is carried out. See [Casting Spells](#casting-spells) for complete information.

### 4. Desist

The end of your turn is declared, at which point it becomes the other player's turn.

## Spells

Spells are uttered aloud over a series of turns as players cast them using word cards from their hand.

### Spell Classes

  * Damage
  * Mend
  * Utility
  * Wild
  * Eraser

Damage spells inflict damage upon the opponent. Mend spells repair damage to the character. Utility spells grant players extra cards. Wild spells have unknown effects until after they are casted. Eraser spells interfere with the opponent's spell casting.

A spell can belong to more than one class.

### Spell Cards

There are two **Spell Types,** each belonging to a **Faction**.

#### GRID Metaphysics Blueprint

A metaphysics blueprint is one of the **Spell Types** that characters can find in the arena. Blueprints have a modern appearance, blue color and contain the ordered **Words** which make up a **Spell Incantation**.

GRID Metaphysics Blueprints are most effective when used by Espers.

#### Gaia Primordial Scroll

These are aged paper scrolls which roll up and are kept together with string.

Gaia Primordial Scrolls are the other **Spell Type** that characters can find in the arena. It contains the ordered words which make up a **Spell Incantation**.

Most effective when used by mages.

### Cross-Faction Spell Usage

Each **Faction** has their own **Spell Card Type**, but a character from either faction can cast either **Spell Type**. To use a **Spell Type** from the opponent's faction to cast a **Spell** creates a **Contaminated Spell**, which is completely effective.

The side effect of **Cross-Faction Spell Usage** is that the **Contaminated Spell** does not level up the character.

## Words

Words are the building blocks of **Spells**. String **Word Cards** together in the **Incantation Zone** to successfully cast a **Spell**.

### Gaia Words

Mages prefer to use Gaia's word list to create **Pure Spells**. If a Mage casts a **Pure Spell**, the Mage will level up.

1. Absconditus
2. Aliquando
3. Castus
4. Cordeus
5. Dorime
6. Ergo
7. Ineundo
8. Pluo
9. Procedo
10. Proxy
11. Supra
12. Sylvius
13.	Tristis
14.	Varro
15.	Velius
16. Ventus

### GRID Words

Espers prefer to use GRID's word list to create **Pure Spells**. If an Esper casts a **Pure Spell**, the Esper will level up.


1. Catenary
2. Composite
3. Concave
4. Converge
5. Extremum
6. Matrix
7. Radian
8. Scalar
9. Sequence
10. Spheroid
11. Summation
12. Tau
13. Transpose
14. Variable
15. Uniform
16. Vector

### Cross-Faction Word Usage

Each **Faction** has 16 numbered **Words**. **GRID's** 8th word is functionally equivalent to **Gaia's** 8th word. This means that a player may substitute **Scalar** (GRID word #8) with **Pluo** (Gaia word #8) to complete a **Spell.**

There is nothing stopping a **Mage** from using a **GRID** word, or an **Esper** from using a **Gaia** word. To use a **Word** from the opponent's faction to cast a **Spell** creates a **Contaminated Spell**, which is completely effective.

The side effect of Cross-Faction Word Usage is that the **Contaminated Spell** does not level up the character.


## Chance

Players may opt to cast a spell which belongs to the **wild** class. The effect of the spell is determined by a **Chance Card**

### Chance Cards

There are 14 **Chance Cards** in the game which have various effects. There are **Chance cards** which inflict more or less damage to the enemy depending on the faction you belong to. There are **Chance Cards** which inflict damage on the caster, rather than their opponent.

There are also **Chance Cards** which act as a word card of your choice which can be later used to cast spells that would otherwise be difficult. This variety of **Chance Card** must be declared at the time they are drawn from the **Chance Card** stack.

## Combat

Combat is the method of inflicting damage on the enemy in order to eliminate them from the game and secure a victory.

### Casting Spells

**Spells** are casted immediately when they have been completely uttered using **Word Cards** in the **Incantation Zone**.

Your character is only capable of casting spells listed in **Spell Cards** that you have in your **Hand**. Memorizing spells doesn't count!

You can place **Word Cards** into your **Incantation Zone** before you know what spell you are going to cast. You don't even need a **Spell Card** in your hand to place down a **Word Card**. This can be used for many purposes such as minimizing the amount of turns required to cast a spell when you eventually get a hold of a spell card. Delivering words can also be an opportunity for bluffing, by leading an opponent to believe that you are invoking a spell which you have no intention of completing.

### Incantation Zone

The **Incantation Zone** has 8 numbered slots for **Word Cards**. When placing **Word Cards** into the **Incanation Zone**, a small coin or gem is used to keep track of the slot in which a **Word Card** was most recently placed.

The **Incantation Zone** is a loop, which means that once filled up with 8 **Word Cards**, the player will loop back around to slot 1 to continue placing **Word Cards**. Existing **Word Cards** are discarded as the loop continues and the player continues to place new **Word Cards**

Consider the following example.

> All 8 slots are filled with **Word Cards**. The next time the player can place a **Word Card** into their **Incantation Zone**, the existing **Word Card** in slot 1 will be discarded, followed by placing the new **Word Card** into slot 1. The coin or gem is moved to slot 1, to remind the player that slot 1 was the most recently used.

Because the **Incantation Zone** is a loop, a correctly ordered 4 word **Spell** in **Incantation Zone** slots 7, 8, 1, and 2 is a valid **Spell**.


### Pure Spells

**Pure Spells** are any spell which was cast using only words from the character's **Faction**.

### Contaminated Spells

**Contaminated Spells** are any spell which was cast using a mixture of **Gaia** and **GRID** words.

### Levelling Up

**Pure Spells** which are successfully cast level up your character by being placed in the **Character Level Zone** after the effects are carried out. **Contaminated Spells** do not level up your character, and are discarded after their effects are carried out.

Characters start at level zero. Leveling up gives the character a benefit of inflicting +1 damage per level. This damage bonus applies to *all* sources of damage, including **Spells**, and **Chance Cards**.
